21 Blackjack Game made with plain html/css/js

## Description 
In this repo you will find a whole blackjack game that I created as learning project, it allows the player to bet, shows you the total points of both hands and resolve the game by itself if you go over 21 points.
At the same time, it adapts the value of Ace from 10 to 1 in case your points will make you lose to be as accurate as possible to real rules.
